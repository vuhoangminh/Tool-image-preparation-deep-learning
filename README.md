Machine Learning applies machine learning algorithms to learn from data. It is critical that you
feed them the right data for the problem you want to solve. Even if you have good data, you need
to make sure that it is on a useful scale, format and even that essential features are included. To
get a better result, it is recommended to look through your data, see the quality and quantity of
data, work to improve the quality of images and/or apply augmentation to increase your dataset or
remove unwanted images. The process for getting data ready for a machine learning algorithmcan be
summarized in three steps [1]:
1. Data collection and selection
2. Image preprocessing
3. Image augmentation
